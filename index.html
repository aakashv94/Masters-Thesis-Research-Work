Simulation of Stochastic Processes.

This page takes you with various methods of simulating various key stochastics processes such as Discret-Time Markov Chain, 
Continous-Time Markov chain, Semi-Markov process. These process help in modelling the behaviour of several key parameters of
financial models. The initial part of my masters project deals in account for the same and is the study of these process with
aim to simulate them and use the simulated result to empirically verify theoretical ones.
