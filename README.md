This page is account for the research work done during my  <var>5<sup>th</sup></var> year Masters Thesis project work. The project was heavily motivated
by the ideas from Mathematical finance and is as such the study of several stochastic process which help in modelling the stock price dynamics using the financial models. In the middle phase, the discussion about financial models from primal stages of finance and nobel prize winning Black-Scholes-Merton model (popularly known as BSM model) to much evolved Heston model, Markov-Modulated GBM (MMGBM) model and Jump Diffusion model. Although all of these models were part of the study but main focus due to time-boundation and scope of masters project was primarily on MMGBM model.
